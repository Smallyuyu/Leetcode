## 題目說明
[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/?envType=study-plan&id=algorithm-i)

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

**Example 2:**

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

**Constraints:**

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.


## 思路一 
```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left=0;
        int right=numbers.size()-1;
        while((numbers[left]+numbers[right]) !=target){
            if((numbers[left]+numbers[right]) > target){
                right--;
            }
            else{
                left++;
            }
        }
        vector<int> ans;
        ans.push_back(left+1);
        ans.push_back(right+1);
        return ans;
    }
};
```
